            <p>The goal of this project is to develop a quick and easy reference
                to see what's going on in the world of Warframe. From alerts to 
                current sales, you can get a quick glance and see if you want to hop
                on for a quick sortie or two. Hit the navigation on the top left to
                get started.</p>
            
            <p>This project is currently in an early alpha stage, so please
                note that there may be some bugs or issues! Also, please note 
                that this project is currently <strong>only for PC</strong>,
                although it's in the pipeline to get xbox/ps4 support soon.</p>
